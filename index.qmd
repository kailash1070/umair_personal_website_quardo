Highly motivated and detail-oriented professional with a strong background in software development. With ability to work independently and as part of a team to solve challenging problems. Strong communication and analytical skills, with a passion for learning and exploring new technologies. **jack of all trades**.

Nelson is a competent enough software developer to maintain a low-level job at Hooli, but does not bring any exceptional skill to cutting-edge projects such as Pied Piper, which causes a mismatch with his genius-level coworkers.
